- Add api methods to components

- Move components into List<BaseComponent> on BaseElement and access using const keys (eg. ComponentNames.HoverTextGraphics)
	- Allows for easy mass access

- If feasible, replace hover components with transitions
	- Allows for much more flexability, grow/move/change-color transitions etc on hover
	- Requires overhaul of frame/hoverframe/default frame etc

- Fix bug with 0 or very low transition durations causing incomplete/bad transitions

- Logging

- Write up documentation for using Frames

	-----------------

[X] On hooks (hover, click etc.), look for and, if exists, fire "{name}.{hook}.py"
	- Script uses api methods to do transitions
	- Include above work as part of this
	- eg. Special button twinkles and changes color on hover. On hover:
		- Gets "special-button.hover.py" and execute
		- Script calls this.AddTwinkleAnimation(duration) and this.ChangeColor(color, duration)

	-TOO SLOW, DON'T DO THIS, DEFINE ANY TRANSITIONS IN JSON
